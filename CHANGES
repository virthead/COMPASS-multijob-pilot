User analysis job          : Testing at ANALY_MWT2_SL6 (FAX test below) OK
prun                       : Test with Hello World example, then via HC?

Code contribution from Vincenzo Lavorini, July 29, 2014

Added the subprocess method Popen and Call, for managing CURL calls;
Added filename and scope to the replica class
In the __init__ phase of aria2cSiteMover class a rucio token is taken by a CURL call; the token is then saved to a file. N.B. The CURL call
expect to have the $X509_USER_PROXY and the $RUCIO_ACCOUNT defined; the self.getSurl2httpsMap is deleted;
In th surls2metalink method, the rucio token on the file i open, and the metalink is retrieved by a CURL call;
get_data() now accepts a scope
and last, in order to get the mover to work, I had to initialize the srmhost=None in surls2metalink method. But maybe this row must be deleted
